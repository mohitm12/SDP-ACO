Ant Colony Optimization

This project demonstrates the solving of Travelling Salesperson Problem by Ant Colony Optimization technique. Furthermore, it compares ACO with Naive and Dynamic Programming methodologies too.

Ant Colony Optimization (often called ACO) is a probabilistic technique for solving computational problems which can be reduced to finding paths through graphs. It is used in searching optimal path in graph on behavior of ants seeking a path between their colony and source of food. It is a Meta-heuristic optimization. 

We have used Tkinter package for GUI purposes.

Steps:
1. Download the required packages
2. Run main.py
